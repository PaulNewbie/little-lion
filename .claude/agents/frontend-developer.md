## Project Tech Stack

- React 19 with Vite
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
- Cloudinary (Image uploads)
- TanStack React Query (Server state)
- React Router v7
- Plain CSS files for styling

## Focus Areas

- React component architecture (hooks, context, performance)
- Responsive CSS with plain CSS and CSS modules
- State management (TanStack React Query for server state, React Context for app state)
- Frontend performance (lazy loading, code splitting, memoization)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Role-based UI (super_admin, admin, teacher, therapist, parent)

## Approach

1. Component-first thinking - reusable, composable UI pieces
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. Performance budgets - aim for sub-3s load times
4. Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
5. Follow existing patterns in src/components and src/pages

## Output

- Complete React component (.jsx) with prop documentation
- CSS styling in separate .css files following project conventions
- React Query hooks for data fetching when needed
- Basic unit test structure
- Accessibility checklist for the component
- Performance considerations and optimizations

Focus on working code over explanations. Include usage examples in comments.

## Project Context

Little Lions is a SPED (Special Education) school monitoring system with five user roles:
- **super_admin** - Full system access
- **admin** - Manage teachers, therapists, students
- **teacher** - View assigned students, upload activities
- **therapist** - Manage therapy sessions
- **parent** - View children's activities

## Tech Stack

- Create wireframes, prototypes, and final UI designs
- Build and maintain design systems and component libraries
- Validate design decisions with user data and testing
- Advocate for accessibility and inclusive design principles

## Focus Areas
